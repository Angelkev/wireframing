## 0. Introduction to Wireframing (mandatory)

### What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a digital interface, such as a website or application. It focuses on content placement, navigation, and functionality without emphasizing design details like colors, fonts, or images.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies structure early**: Helps teams define the information architecture and layout before diving into detailed design.  
- **Saves time and cost**: Iterating on low-fidelity mockups is faster and less expensive than revising high-fidelity designs or code.  
- **Enhances collaboration**: Provides a shared reference point for designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Identifies usability issues**: Reveals potential layout or flow problems early, reducing risks later in development.  

### When to Use Wireframes
Wireframes are typically used in the early stages of the design process to explore ideas, align team members, and validate workflows before moving into visual design or prototyping.

## 1. Key Elements of Wireframing (mandatory)

Wireframes typically include several core elements that define the usability and user experience of a digital product:

### 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall framework of the page or screen, organizing major sections.  
**Example:** A website may have a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer clearly divided. This helps teams visualize how information will be distributed and prioritized.

### 2. Navigation
Shows how users will move through the interface.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar with menu items (Home, About, Contact) ensures users can easily locate and switch between key sections of a site or app.

### 3. Content Placement
Determines where text, images, and media will appear.  
**Example:** Placing a hero banner at the top of a homepage with a call-to-action button ensures critical messaging is seen first, guiding users toward desired actions.

### 4. Functionality
Indicates interactive components such as buttons, forms, and links.  
**Example:** A login wireframe may include input fields for username and password, with a “Submit” button showing how users will interact with the system.
