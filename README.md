## 0. Introduction to Wireframing (mandatory)

### What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a digital interface, such as a website or application. It focuses on content placement, navigation, and functionality without emphasizing design details like colors, fonts, or images.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies structure early**: Helps teams define the information architecture and layout before diving into detailed design.  
- **Saves time and cost**: Iterating on low-fidelity mockups is faster and less expensive than revising high-fidelity designs or code.  
- **Enhances collaboration**: Provides a shared reference point for designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Identifies usability issues**: Reveals potential layout or flow problems early, reducing risks later in development.  

### When to Use Wireframes
Wireframes are typically used in the early stages of the design process to explore ideas, align team members, and validate workflows before moving into visual design or prototyping.
