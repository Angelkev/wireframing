## 0. Introduction to Wireframing (mandatory)

### What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a digital interface, such as a website or application. It focuses on content placement, navigation, and functionality without emphasizing design details like colors, fonts, or images.

### Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

* **Clarifies structure early**: Helps teams define the information architecture and layout before diving into detailed design.
* **Saves time and cost**: Iterating on low-fidelity mockups is faster and less expensive than revising high-fidelity designs or code.
* **Enhances collaboration**: Provides a shared reference point for designers, developers, and stakeholders.
* **Identifies usability issues**: Reveals potential layout or flow problems early, reducing risks later in development.

### When to Use Wireframes

Wireframes are typically used in the early stages of the design process to explore ideas, align team members, and validate workflows before moving into visual design or prototyping.

## 1. Key Elements of Wireframing (mandatory)

Wireframes typically include several core elements that define the usability and user experience of a digital product:

### 1. Layout Structure

Defines the overall framework of the page or screen, organizing major sections.
**Example:** A website may have a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer clearly divided. This helps teams visualize how information will be distributed and prioritized.

### 2. Navigation

Shows how users will move through the interface.
**Example:** A top navigation bar with menu items (Home, About, Contact) ensures users can easily locate and switch between key sections of a site or app.

### 3. Content Placement

Determines where text, images, and media will appear.
**Example:** Placing a hero banner at the top of a homepage with a call-to-action button ensures critical messaging is seen first, guiding users toward desired actions.

### 4. Functionality

Indicates interactive components such as buttons, forms, and links.
**Example:** A login wireframe may include input fields for username and password, with a “Submit” button showing how users will interact with the system.

## 2. Types of Wireframes (mandatory)

Wireframes can be created at different levels of fidelity, depending on the stage of the design process and the goals of the team.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

* **Definition:** Simple sketches or block diagrams that outline the basic structure of a page without detail.
* **Purpose:** Focuses on overall layout, information hierarchy, and user flow.
* **Appearance:** Black-and-white, with placeholder boxes for images and lorem ipsum text for content.
* **When Used:** Early stages of brainstorming and ideation, when quick iteration and team alignment are more important than visual detail.

**Example Contribution:** Using rectangles and circles to indicate images and buttons ensures stakeholders can focus on structure rather than design aesthetics.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes

* **Definition:** Detailed, polished representations of a page that closely resemble the final design.
* **Purpose:** Demonstrates layout, spacing, content, and interactivity with more realism.
* **Appearance:** Includes actual text, images, and sometimes clickable elements for testing.
* **When Used:** Later stages of the design process, for usability testing or developer handoff.

**Example Contribution:** A high-fidelity wireframe of a landing page might include real product photos, meaningful headlines, and working navigation links for accurate user testing.

## What Type of Wireframe is This?

The README.md you are currently reading is **not a wireframe itself** but an instructional document. If represented visually, it would most likely start as a **low-fidelity wireframe** (with text boxes and section placeholders) before evolving into a **high-fidelity design** in a UI tool.

## 3. Wireframing Tools (mandatory)

There are many tools available to create wireframes, ranging from simple sketching apps to advanced collaborative design platforms.

### Popular Tools

* **Balsamiq**: Known for its sketch-style interface, great for low-fidelity wireframes.
* **Axure RP**: Offers powerful features for interactive prototypes and detailed documentation.
* **Sketch**: Popular among UI designers, supports both wireframing and high-fidelity design.
* **Adobe XD**: Provides vector-based tools and prototyping capabilities.

### Recommended Tool: Figma

**Figma** is a web-based collaborative design tool that has become one of the most popular choices for wireframing and prototyping.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time collaboration: Multiple team members can work on the same file simultaneously.
* Browser-based: No installation needed, accessible from anywhere.
* Cross-platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux (via browser), and even mobile.
* Versatile: Supports low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity designs, and interactive prototypes.
* Plugins & Templates: Extensive community resources to speed up the workflow.

**Why it’s useful for wireframing:**
Figma allows teams to brainstorm and sketch early wireframes quickly, then evolve them into high-fidelity mockups without switching tools. Its collaborative nature ensures designers, developers, and stakeholders remain aligned throughout the process.
